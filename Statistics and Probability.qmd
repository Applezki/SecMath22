# Probability of Two Events

Let us recall from our previous lesson the following concepts on probability.

1.  The probability of an event (E) is given by the formula:

𝑷(𝑬) = 𝒏𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒇𝒂𝒗𝒐𝒓𝒂𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒔 𝒏(𝑬) / 𝒏𝒖𝒎𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒐𝒇 𝒂𝒍𝒍 𝒑𝒐𝒔𝒔𝒊𝒃𝒍𝒆 𝒐𝒖𝒕𝒄𝒐𝒎𝒆𝒔 𝒏(𝑺)

2.  The probability of an event must be a number from 0 to 1. That is, 𝟎 ≤ 𝑷(𝑬) ≤ 𝟏.

3.  The union of events A and B, denoted by A ∪ B, is the set of all outcomes for either A or B.

4.  The intersection of events A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is the set of all outcomes shared by A and B.

### Exercise 1

Direction: Identify whether the events can happen at the same time or if they can’t happen at the same time. Write your answer at the column where they are belonged.

Events:

1)  A = tossing a coin and getting a head

    B = tossing a coin and getting a tail

2)  A = rolling a die and getting a factor of 6

    B = rolling a die and getting a prime number

3)  A = a heart is drawn from a standard deck of cards

    B = a face card is drawn from a standard deck of cards

4)  A = an ‘8’ is drawn from a standard deck of cards

    B = a king is drawn from a standard deck of cards

5)  A = a multiple of 3 turning up in rolling a die once

    B = a factor of 4 turning up in rolling a die once

|                                |                                  |
|:------------------------------:|:--------------------------------:|
| It can happen at the same time | It can't happen at the same time |
|                                |                                  |

Were you able to identify the events that can occur at the same time and the events that cannot occur at the same time?

The pair of events in Exercise 1 are compound events and they could either be mutually exclusive or not mutually exclusive events.

## Compound Event

A compound event consists of two or more simple events that are connected by the word and or or.

## Mutually Exclusive Event

Two events are mutually exclusive if both events cannot occur at the same time. These events have no common elements. They are also called disjoint events.

Example 1. In tossing a coin once, the events of getting a head and getting a tail are mutually exclusive events because they cannot appear at the same time. If A is the event of getting a head and B is the event of getting a tail, then, 𝑨 ∩ 𝑩 = { } or 𝑛(𝑨 ∩ 𝑩) = 𝟎. That is, there is no common element in events A and B.

## Not Mutually Exclusive Event

Two events are not mutually exclusive if both events can occur at the same time. These events have common elements. They are also called inclusive events.

Example 2. In rolling a six-sided die once, the events ‘a 2 turning up’ and ‘an even number turning up’ are not mutually exclusive events. If A is the event of ‘a 2 turning up’ and B is the event of ‘an even number turning up’, then, A = {2} and B = {2, 4, 6}. Observe that the number 2 is common to both events A and B, therefore, 𝑨 ∩ 𝑩 = {𝟐} 𝑜𝑟 𝑛(𝑨 ∩ 𝑩) = 𝟏.

## Probability of Mutually Exclusive Events

If two events, A and B, are mutually exclusive, then the probability that either A or B occurs is the sum of their probabilities. In symbols

𝑷(𝑨 𝐨𝐫 𝑩) = 𝑷(𝑨 ∪ 𝑩) = 𝑷(𝑨) + 𝑷(𝑩)

Example. A bag contains 4 blue marbles, 8 green marbles and 6 red marbles. Carlo draws one ball at random. What is the probability that the marble is either red or green?

Solution: A ball cannot be both red and green, so these are mutually exclusive events.

𝑃(red or green) = 𝑃(red) + 𝑃(green) = 6/18 + 8/18 = 14/18 or 7/9

The probability that the drawn marble is either red or green is 7/9.

## Probability of Mutually Exclusive Events

Probability of Not Mutually Exclusive Events For any two events A and B of the same experiment which are not mutually exclusive events, the probability of the union of A and B is

𝑷(𝑨 𝒐𝒓 𝑩) = 𝑷(𝑨) + 𝑷(𝑩) − 𝑷(𝑨 𝒂𝒏𝒅 𝑩) 𝑷(𝑨 ∪ 𝑩) = 𝑷(𝑨) + 𝑷(𝑩) − 𝑷(𝑨 ∩ 𝑩)
